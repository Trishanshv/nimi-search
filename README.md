# Nimi Search
    A note on the name:If (you are wondering why it is named nimi search || you assumed that it might have been a typo)                                                     {sorry to say this but i have a very bad naming sense}

A Mini Search Engine in C++ (From Scratch, No STL Vector)Nimi-Search is a low-level, educational search engine implemented in modern C++ for Windows (MinGW).
The project is designed to demonstrate core search-engine internals—such as crawling, tokenization, indexing, ranking, caching, and query processing—built without using std::vector,
relying instead on custom memory-managed containers. This project focuses strictly on systems-level data structures and algorithms rather than frameworks.

##Build Instructions (Windows / MinGW)
```
RequirementsCMake ≥ 3.10MinGW-w64 (GCC)C++17 enabledBuild StepsCreate a build directory and generate Makefiles:Bashmkdir build
cd build
cmake -G "MinGW Makefiles" -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug ..
Compile the project:Bashmingw32-make
RunTo run the engine against a data directory:Bash./nimi_search.exe data
```
##How It Works
When you run the executable, the engine performs the following pipeline:BFS Crawling: Performs a Breadth-First Search on the target folder up to the configured depth.Discovery: Identifies .txt files in the directory tree.Ingestion: Loads full file contents into memory.Processing: Normalizes text (lowercasing, punctuation removal) and tokenizes the content.Filtering: Applies stop-word filtering using config/stopwords.txt.Output: Prints discovered document paths and prepares data for indexing.💡 Design PrinciplesNo std::vector: Utilizes custom manual memory management to demonstrate understanding of heap allocation and resizing logic.Systems-Level Focus: Prioritizes raw pointers and custom containers over high-level STL abstractions where educational value is high.BFS Traversal: Implements graph traversal algorithms for file system crawling.Clean Architecture: Modular separation of concerns (Crawler vs. Parser vs. Data Structures).Warning-Clean: Compiles with -Wall -Wextra for strict code quality.🔮 Roadmap (In Progress)The following modules are currently in development to transition from a crawler to a full search engine:[ ] Inverted Index: Mapping tokens to document IDs (Posting lists).[ ] Trie-based Autocomplete: Efficient prefix search for query suggestions.[ ] Ranking Algorithms: TF-IDF scoring and Top-K retrieval.[ ] Spell Correction: Levenshtein distance implementation.[ ] Caching: LRU (Least Recently Used) cache for frequent queries.[ ] Advanced Scoring: Bloom Filters and PageRank.[ ] Interactive Shell: CLI for user search queries.[ ] Profiling: Benchmarks for memory usage and speed.

##Why This Project Exists
This project is intentionally built from scratch to demonstrate:Deep understanding of memory layouts and pointer arithmetic.Low-level container design (implementation of dynamic arrays).Core information-retrieval algorithms (Indexing, Ranking, Tokenizing).Performance-aware C++ development
